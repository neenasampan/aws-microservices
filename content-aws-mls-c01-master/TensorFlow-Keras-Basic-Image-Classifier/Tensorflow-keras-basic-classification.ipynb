    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Linux Academy hands-on lab, we take an introductory look at __TensorFlow__ with __Keras__ and use it to make a simple artificial neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow (backed by Google) is an end-to-end, open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources. This lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "_(Source: https://www.tensorflow.org/)_\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.\n",
    "\n",
    "_(Source: https://keras.io/)_\n",
    "\n",
    "__Or, to put it another way:__\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is a complex tool. Keras has been built ontop of TensorFlow as a more user-friendly interface. It helps us rapidly prototype models, and we use it in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "We have bricks, lots of brick. Lego bricks that is. And we need to sort them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a collection of photos of different Lego bricks from different angles. We have 600 photos (really we do) and they are all labeled with the brick name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each photo has been processed. This involved increasing the contrast, sharpening, removing the color, inverting the colors, and reducing the size.\n",
    "\n",
    "|![Sample Lego brick photo](./sample-before.png)|![Sample Lego brick photo](./sample-after.png)|\n",
    "|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Sample before processing                | Sample after processing                |\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this, we loaded all the images into a single data array for easier loading into the algorithm.  If you're interested in how these images were collected and processed, contact me through the Linux Academy Community Slack: ```@mike chambers```.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to create a simple, deep learning, neural network classifier model. We will train the model using the photo data and see if it correctly predicts or infers the type of a brick from a supplied test image."
